Radionuclide Removal in Rare Earth Mineral Processing: A Review of Existing Methods and Emerging Biochemical Approaches Using Siderophores,"Emmanuel Atta Mends, Pengbo Chu",2025-12-15,Minerals,Academic,https://doi.org/10.3390/min15121308,"The extraction of rare earth elements is becoming increasingly essential due to their many applications in current and emerging advanced material technologies. However, in many rare earth deposits, rare earth minerals are associated with radionuclides; specifically, thorium and uranium. The radioactive nature of these elements is a major concern during processing. Techniques such as solvent extraction and precipitation have been employed in this regard to minimize the radioactivity levels and address any related processing or environmental concerns. However, they face various challenges such as high chemical reagent consumption, secondary waste generation, and limited selectivity, which hinder either their scalability or sustainability. The current study provides a literature review about these technologies to provide critical insights on their applications and discuss the challenges hampering their extensive use in the mining industry. Biotechnology is also evaluated and highlighted as a promising, cost-effective, and low-environmental-impact option for the selective recovery of radionuclides from rare earth elements. Specifically, pyoverdine siderophores were discussed due to their catecholates and hydroxamate moieties which have high affinity for radionuclides to enhance selective recovery during rare earth processing. Conversely, integration of this approach into existing mineral processing flowsheets is a constraint. Hence, future studies should focus on optimizing the kinetics of siderophore synthesis and explore a hybrid approach to combine the biotechnological and conventional techniques.",,,,
Petrogenesis of Himalayan Leucogranites: A Perspective from Zircon Trace Elements,"Weirui Lu, Zeming Zhang, Jia Yuan, Yang Zhang, Qiang Li, Yu An, Di Zhan",2025-12-15,Minerals,Academic,https://doi.org/10.3390/min15121306,"Magmatic zircon trace element compositions and their variation trends provide valuable insights into the nature and evolutionary processes of magmatic rocks. The Himalayan orogen contains widespread leucogranites. Despite extensive studies on these granites, the features and petrogenetic implications of trace element composition of zircons from the leucogranites remain poorly constrained. In this study, we present a comprehensive dataset comprising new cathodoluminescence (CL) images, U-Pb ages, and trace element compositions of zircons from the Himalayan leucogranites, and compare them to the previously reported trace element data of zircon from I-type granites. Our results show that zircons from the Himalayan leucogranites have high Hf, U, Y, P, Th, Sc, and heavy rare earth element contents (HREE), and low Nb, Ta, Ti, and light rare earth element contents (LREE), and can be divided into two types. Type I (low-U) zircons exhibit well-developed oscillatory zoning, and the U concentrations are mostly &lt;5000 ppm. Type II (high-U) zircons display mottled or spongy textures and possess elevated U contents that are mostly &gt;5000 ppm. Zircons from the Himalayan leucogranites have higher contents of U, Hf, Nb, Ta, and elevated U/Yb ratios, but lower Th/U, Eu/Eu*, Ce/Ce*, LREE/HREE, and Ce/U values than those from I-type granitic zircons. Furthermore, zircons in the Himalayan leucogranites have gradually decreasing Th, Ti, Th/U, Eu/Eu*, and Ce/Ce*, and increasing U, Nb, Ta, and (Yb/Gd)N with increasing Hf. These geochemical features suggest the magmas involved in the genesis of leucogranites originated from the partial melting of metasedimentary sources under relatively reduced conditions, and underwent a high degree of magmatic fractionation.",,,,
Study on the Crystal Structure and Electronic Properties of Tennantite and Enargite,"Dong Yang, Yuqiong Li, Faqi Qu, Meiguang Jiang, Ciren Quni, Wenjie Zhang, Jianhua Chen, Yuxin Guo",2025-12-15,Minerals,Academic,https://doi.org/10.3390/min15121307,"Tennantite (Cu12As4S13) and enargite (Cu3AsS4) are two important minerals that simultaneously contain copper and arsenic. Detailed studies of their structure and properties are crucial for understanding their oxidation, flotation, and leaching. This study investigates the crystal structures, electronic properties, and reactivity of these two copper-arsenic minerals from the perspectives of atomic bonding, charge, density of states, and d-orbital splitting. The results indicate that tennantite is a crystal with mixed Cu valence states of +2 and +1 (predominantly +1), while the Cu in enargite is in the +1 state. The valence state of As in tennantite (+3) is lower than that in enargite (+5). Orbital energy level calculations show that the energy gaps between the copper d-orbitals are small in both minerals, indicating strong electron delocalization and, consequently, strong covalent character in the crystals, which is also confirmed by Mulliken bond population calculations. The presence of arsenic is the reason for the enhanced covalency. It is noteworthy that tennantite exhibits stronger covalency. The Cu 3d and As 4p electrons in tennantite are more electronically active than those in enargite. In tennantite, the strong d-electron delocalization caused by d-p hybridization between Cu and S leads to similar 3d electronic properties between 3-coordinated and 4-coordinated Cu. The energies of the five d-orbitals of the 4-coordinated Cu in enargite are lower than those of the 4-coordinated Cu in tennantite, which may affect the ability of Cu 3d electrons to enter the empty orbitals of S atoms in sulfur-containing collectors to form π back-bonding, thereby reducing the collecting ability of enargite. On the other hand, the splitting energy of the 4-coordinated Cu 3d orbitals in enargite is significantly smaller than that in tennantite, making the structure less stable and, thus, potentially more prone to dissolution.",,,,
"Advanced 3D Inversion of Airborne EM and Magnetic Data with IP Effects and Remanent Magnetization Modeling: Application to the Mpatasie Gold Belt, Ghana","Michael S. Zhdanov, Leif H. Cox, Michael Jorgensen, Douglas H. Pitcher",2025-12-15,Minerals,Academic,https://doi.org/10.3390/min15121305,"We present an integrated methodology for three-dimensional inversion of large-scale airborne electromagnetic (AEM) and magnetic survey data that simultaneously recovers electrical conductivity, chargeability, and both induced and remanent magnetizations. A central feature of the AEM component is the explicit incorporation of induced polarization (IP) effects. Neglecting IP responses can lead to biased conductivity models, particularly in mineralized systems where disseminated sulfides contribute strongly to chargeability. Using the Generalized Effective-Medium Theory of Induced Polarization (GEMTIP), the inversion produces physically consistent 3D distributions of conductivity and chargeability. To enhance magnetic interpretation, we also implement a vector magnetic inversion that resolves both induced and remanent magnetization from Total Magnetic Intensity (TMI) data, enabling geologically realistic magnetization models in terranes with significant remanence. This integrated workflow was applied to airborne AEM and TMI datasets collected over the Asankrangwa Gold Belt in central Ghana. The inversion results delineate a key exploration target defined by coincident magnetic low and elevated chargeability, interpreted as sulfide-rich gold mineralization and subsequently confirmed by drilling. These results demonstrate that jointly accounting for IP and remanent magnetization in 3D inversion substantially improves subsurface characterization and provides a powerful tool for mineral exploration in structurally and lithologically complex environments.",,,,
"Thermal, Structural, and Phase Evolution of the Y2(SO4)3*8H2O–Eu2(SO4)3*8H2O System via Dehydration and Volatilization to Y2(SO4)3–Eu2(SO4)3 and Y2O2(SO4)–Eu2O2(SO4) and Its Thermal Expansion","Andrey P. Shablinskii, Olga Yu. Shorets, Rimma S. Bubnova, Maria G. Krzhizhanovskaya, Margarita S. Avdontceva, Stanislav K. Filatov",2025-12-14,Minerals,Academic,https://doi.org/10.3390/min15121304,"The synthesis, crystal structure, phase transformations, and thermal expansion of (Y1–xEux)2(SO4)3*8H2O (where x = 0, 0.17, 0.33, 0.50, 0.66, 0.83, and 1) are presented. (Y1–xEux)2(SO4)3*8H2O solid solutions were synthesized via crystallization from an aqueous solution. (Y1–xEux)2(SO4)3*8H2O (C2/c) ↔ (Y1–xEux)2(SO4)3 (Pbcn) → (Y1–xEux)2O2SO4 (C2/c) and Eu2(SO4)3*8H2O (C2/c) ↔ Eu2(SO4)3 (C2/c) → Eu2O2SO4 (C2/c) phase transformations for all samples were investigated by high-temperature powder X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry in the temperature ranges of 25–750 and 25–1350 °C, respectively. The aim of this work is to identify the structural heredity of the phases formed during thermal transformations of (Y1–xEux)2(SO4)3*8H2O solid solutions, and to study the mechanisms of the thermal deformations of the crystal structure. Structural relations between these phases were found. The crystal structures of YEu(SO4)3*8H2O and (Y0.83Eu0.17)2(SO4)3*8H2O were refined at −173, −123, −73, −23, 27, and 77 °С.

The thermal expansion of Eu2(SO4)3 was highest in the direction approximately coinciding with the c-axis, because the Eu–O chains extended in this direction. As temperature increased, the crystal structure of (Y1–xEux)2(SO4)3*8H2O expanded significantly in the ac plane along directions close to the a and c axes, while thermal expansion along the b axis was relatively low. The distance between layers in the (Y1–xEux)2(SO4)3*8H2O crystal structure increased with increasing temperature, and corrugated layers (parallel to (101) direction) straightened out due to the rotation of the S2O4 tetrahedra. At high temperature, thermal expansion of Y2O2SO4 was highest along the longer diagonal of the ac parallelogram perpendicular to the plane of the oxo-centered 2∞[YO] layers.",,,,
Anode Protection Strategies for Next-Generation Lithium–Oxygen Batteries: Toward Dendrite-Free Lithium Metal at Practical Current Densities,"Myeong-Chang Sung, Minhe Kim, Jiyoon Yu, Changhoon Choi",2025-12-15,Metals,Academic,https://doi.org/10.3390/met15121373,"The promise of lithium–oxygen batteries lie not merely in their record-breaking theoretical energy density, but in the challenge of making such energy truly reversible. Rising as the key obstacle is the lithium metal anode, whose remarkable capacity and low potential come at the cost of dendritic growth, unstable solid electrolyte interphases, and relentless reactions with oxygen species. These instabilities, once overshadowed by cathode-related limitations, now define the frontier of research as current densities and energy demands approach practical levels. This review highlights recent progress in two complementary directions for anode protection: physical approaches, such as artificial protective layers, solid or functional separators, and oxygen-blocking interlayers that isolate and stabilize the surface; and chemical strategies, including electrolyte and additive design that enable in situ formation of LiF- and Li3N-rich interfaces with high ionic conductivity and chemical robustness. Together, these approaches establish a unified framework for achieving dendrite-free and oxygen-resistant lithium interfaces. Mastering solid electrolyte interfacial stability rather than only cathode catalysis will ultimately determine whether lithium oxygen battery can evolve from laboratory prototypes to truly viable high-energy systems.",,,,
Surface Integrity and Corrosion Resistance of Additively Manufactured AZ91 Mg Alloys Post-Processed by Laser Shock Peening,"Shan Gao, Wenquan Wang, Xintian Zhao, Wenhui Yu, Hongyu Zheng, Xingchen Yan, Cheng Chang, Harry M. Ngwangwa, Xiaoli Cui, Zongshen Wang",2025-12-15,Metals,Academic,https://doi.org/10.3390/met15121374,"Mg alloys show great potential in biomedical fields due to superior biocompatibility and biodegradability. Additive manufacturing (AM) provides opportunities in fabricating metallic implants with complex geometries while inherent defects during AM limit its further applications. In this work, laser shock peening (LSP) was employed as a post-processing technique to tailor the surface integrity and corrosion resistance of additively manufactured AZ91 Mg alloy by selective laser melting (SLM). The surface morphology, microstructure and porosity, surface hardness and residual stress, and corrosion resistance of the SLMed alloy before and after LSP were examined. The results show that a gradient structure is formed along the depth direction after LSP and high-density dislocations and high-fraction low-angle grain boundaries are induced. The porosity is gradually reduced in number and size and the highest density of 1.794 g/cm3 is obtained after two impacts of LSP. The surface hardness and residual compressive stress both increase with LSP number and the highest values of 135.26 HV and 40.13 MPa after four impacts, respectively. All of the SLMed alloy samples show improved corrosion resistance after LSP. This work provides a promising route for enhancing the performance of additively manufactured Mg alloys through laser materials surface modification.",,,,
Surrogate-Model Prediction of Mechanical Response in Architected Ti6Al4V Cylindrical TPMS Metamaterials,"Mansoureh Rezapourian, Ali Cheloee Darabi, Mohammadreza Khoshbin, Siegfried Schmauder, Irina Hussainova",2025-12-15,Metals,Academic,https://doi.org/10.3390/met15121372,"A Machine Learning (ML)-based surrogate modeling framework is presented for mapping structure–property relationships in architected Ti6Al4V cylindrical TPMS metamaterials subjected to quasi-static compression. A Python–nTop pipeline automatically generated 3456 cylindrical shell lattices (Gyroid, Diamond, Split-P), and ABAQUS/Explicit simulations with a Johnson–Cook failure model for Ti6Al4V quantified their mechanical response. From 3024 valid designs, key mechanical properties targets including elastic modulus (E), yield stress (Y), ultimate strength (U), plateau stress (PL), and energy absorption (EA) were extracted alongside geometric descriptors such as surface area (SA), surface-area-to-volume ratio (SA/VR), and relative density (RD). A multi-output surrogate model (feedforward neural network) trained on the simulated set accurately predicts these properties directly from seven design parameters (thickness; unit cell counts in X, Y, and Z directions; unit cell orientation; height; diameter), enabling rapid property estimation across large design spaces. Topology-dependent trends indicate that Split-P exhibits the highest strength, energy absorption, and total SA, and shows the largest variation in SA/VR; Gyroid exhibits the lowest SA with a moderate SA/VR; and Diamond is the most compliant lattice and maintains a higher SA/VR than Gyroid despite lower SA. RD increases with both SA and SA/VR across all topologies. The framework provides a reusable computational tool for architectured lattices, enabling quick prescreening of implant designs without repeated finite-element analyses.",,,,
Computational Modeling of the Temperature Distribution in a Butt Weld of AISI 304L Stainless Steel Using a Volumetric Heat Source,"Thiago da Silva Machado, Thiago da Silveira, Liércio André Isoldi, Luiz Antônio Bragança da Cunda",2025-12-14,Metals,Academic,https://doi.org/10.3390/met15121371,"The Finite Element Method is an indispensable tool for analyzing the transient thermal phenomena in welding processes. This study aims to simulate the temperature field during Gas Metal Arc Welding of an AISI 304L V-groove butt joint, employing a volumetric heat source model. The numerical simulations were conducted using ABAQUS SIMULIA® (version 6.11-3) on a plate measuring 200 mm × 50 mm × 9.5 mm. For validation, the numerical results were compared against experimental data obtained at the Welding Engineering Research Laboratory of Federal University of Rio Grande. A parametric study was performed by varying the geometric parameter b (controlling the volumetric heat distribution depth) to enhance the model’s accuracy and achieve the closest approximation to experimental observations. The calibrated volumetric source demonstrated high accuracy, yielding low percentage differences between predicted and experimental peak temperatures: 1.02%, 2.50%, and 4.44% at the 4 mm, 8 mm, and 12 mm thermocouple positions, respectively.",,,,
Evaluation of Sintered Powder Metallurgy Fe-Cr Alloys as Metallic Interconnects for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Applications,"Chien-Kuo Liu, Wei‐Ja Shong",2025-12-12,Metals,Academic,https://doi.org/10.3390/met15121370,"Metallic interconnects are key components in planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks. In the present study, we evaluated four Fe-Cr powder metallurgy (PM) alloy specimens, obtained from a domestic manufacturer, at nominal compositions (in wt%) of 5% Fe-95% Cr, 30% Fe-70% Cr, 50% Fe-50% Cr, and 78% Fe-22% Cr. These specimens were tested and evaluated for use in SOFC stack applications. The verification items included coefficient of thermal expansion measurements, high-temperature oxidation resistance and weight gain tests, mechanical strength tests, high-temperature sealant bonding and leakage rate measurements, and high-temperature electrical property (i.e., area-specific resistance) measurements. In addition, the specimens’ microstructures and elemental compositions were observed and analyzed. The test results indicate that the Fe content of the Fe-Cr powder metallurgy alloys influences various properties, while Cr also plays a significant role in high-temperature oxidation resistance. Among the four alloy specimens, the 78Fe-Cr alloy exhibited all of the aforementioned advantages, including a suitable coefficient of thermal expansion of 12.4 × 10−6/°C, excellent high-temperature oxidation resistance, a thermal weight-gain rate of 5.31 × 10−14 g2/cm4·s, a remarkably low high-temperature area-specific resistance of 7.04 mΩ·cm2, and superior bonding and interfacial stability with the GC9 glass–ceramic sealant, achieving a very low leakage rate of 3.47 × 10−6 mbar·l/s/cm. These results indicate that the 78Fe-Cr powder metallurgy alloy performs excellently and is the most promising candidate for metallic interconnects in SOFC stack applications.",,,,

Sedimentary conditions drive modern pyrite burial flux to exceed oxidation,"Cornelia Mertens, Sarah Paradis, Jordon Hemingway",2025-12-12,Nature Geoscience,Academic,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-025-01855-5,"Abstract Pyrite (iron sulfide) formation and burial in sediments decreases atmospheric CO 2 and increases O 2 levels. However, the environmental and sedimentological conditions that regulate pyrite burial remain poorly constrained. Here we investigate such controlling mechanisms using a non-dimensional diagenetic model that extracts the natural variables governing pyrite formation rate and sulfur isotopic composition ( δ 34 S). Both properties are controlled by the local ratios of organic carbon content to sulfate concentration and organic carbon reactivity to sedimentation rate; formation rate is additionally sensitive to reactive iron delivery. Using only globally interpolated boundary conditions, our model accurately predicts signals in 216 sediment cores distributed across the modern ocean. Extrapolating this, we estimate a global pyrite burial flux of 7.0 × 10 12 mol S yr −1 (sensitivity test range: 2.5 × 10 12 to 19.0 × 10 12 mol S yr −1 ) with a weighted-average δ 34 S value of −4‰ (range: −8 to +3‰). This flux is substantially larger than terrestrial pyrite oxidation, indicating that the sulfur cycle is currently not in steady state but is instead described by net pyrite burial and thus atmospheric O 2 accumulation. Finally, we interpret the geologic pyrite δ 34 S record within this model framework and identify flooded shelf area as the main control on pyrite burial throughout the Phanerozoic Eon.",,,,

Unequal mitochondrial segregation promotes asymmetric fates during neurogenesis,"Benjamin Bunel, Rémi Leclercq, Rosette Goïame, Arnaud Gautier, Xavier Morin, Evelyne Fischer",2025-12-15,Nature Communications,Academic,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-66932-0,"Abstract Asymmetric cell division plays a critical role during vertebrate neurogenesis by generating neuronal cells while maintaining a pool of progenitors. It relies on unequal distribution of cell fate determinants during progenitor division. Here, we use live imaging in the chick embryonic neuroepithelium to demonstrate that mitochondria behave as asymmetric fate determinants during mitosis. We show that the frequency of unequal distribution of mitochondria increases in parallel with the rate of asymmetric divisions during development. Furthermore, fate tracking experiments reveals that following progenitor division, a cell inheriting fewer mitochondria than its sister consistently differentiates into a neuron. We set up a chemogenetic approach to experimentally displace mitochondria specifically during mitosis to force their unequal inheritance and find that this drives premature neuronal differentiation. In this work, we establish a direct causal relationship between unequal mitochondrial inheritance and the asymmetric fate of sister cells in vivo, revealing a pivotal mechanism for neurogenesis.",,,,
Single-neuron correlates of visual consciousness in human lateral occipital complex,"Michaël Vanhoyland, Peter Janssen, Tom Theys",2025-12-15,Nature Communications,Academic,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-67077-w,"Abstract Conscious perception, a critical aspect of human cognition, is assumed to emerge from a complex network of interacting brain regions that transmit information via feedforward and recurrent pathways. This study presents single- and multiunit recordings from the human lateral occipital complex (LO), a key region for shape and object recognition, during three distinct perceptual paradigms: backward masking, flash suppression and binocular rivalry. Stimulus awareness increased decoding accuracy and decoders assigned higher probabilities to the consciously perceived stimulus during periods of dichoptic stimulus presentation. These findings highlight the intricate neural mechanisms underlying visual awareness and show that LO responses predominantly align with subjective phenomenology, offering new insights into the neural correlates of visual consciousness.",,,,

Assessment of Elemental Partitioning in a Copper Flash Smelting Furnace Under Varying Operational Scenarios,Patricia Córdoba,2025-12-15,Journal of Sustainable Metallurgy,Academic,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40831-025-01369-9,"Abstract This study presents a multi-element, industrial-scale evaluation of elemental partitioning in a copper (Cu) flash smelting furnace under varying dust recirculation conditions. Comprehensive chemical characterization of the smelting feed, matte, slag, and dust was performed across three operational scenarios: no recirculation, partial recirculation (60–70%), and full recirculation (100%). Dust recirculation was found to significantly alter the distribution of volatile, semi-volatile, and refractory elements: emissions of Pb, Zn, Sb, Bi, and Mo increased, while Hg retention in the matte improved. Selenium (Se) and cobalt (Co) remained relatively stable, with partitioning largely controlled by redox conditions and speciation. Statistical analysis enabled classification of elements by sensitivity to recirculation: Type I—highly sensitive (Pb, Zn, Sb, Se, Hg); Type II—moderately sensitive (Mo, Ni); and Type III—stable (Co, Te). These findings, validated with industrial process data, provide critical insights for optimizing residue management, minimizing emissions, and supporting circular economy strategies in primary Cu smelting.

The traditional continuum finite element method (FEM) approaches use the intact rock properties with some reduction by using rock mass classification systems such as the Geological Strength Index and design the slope based on the critical strength reduction factors. A limitation of this approach is that the reduction of the rock mass properties might not be accurate enough for the rock slopes with heavily jointed rock mass. This study uses a three-dimensional Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) approach to understand the inherent limitations of continuum methods in capturing discontinuous rock slope failure with increasing fracture density. The fracture network was constructed from the field data of an iron ore mine comprising detailed face mappings of 560 joints in both the host rock and the iron ore, while the intact rock properties were derived from core samples obtained through 98 boreholes. Comparative analysis across fracture intensities revealed that the conventional FEM-based methods substantially underestimate the influence of joint volume, yielding higher factors of safety than the DFN approach, highlighting the importance of incorporating DFN models over continuum-based approaches, particularly under increasing fracture density.",,,,
