Radionuclide Removal in Rare Earth Mineral Processing: A Review of Existing Methods and Emerging Biochemical Approaches Using Siderophores,"Emmanuel Atta Mends, Pengbo Chu",2025-12-15,Minerals,Academic,https://doi.org/10.3390/min15121308,"The extraction of rare earth elements is becoming increasingly essential due to their many applications in current and emerging advanced material technologies. However, in many rare earth deposits, rare earth minerals are associated with radionuclides; specifically, thorium and uranium. The radioactive nature of these elements is a major concern during processing. Techniques such as solvent extraction and precipitation have been employed in this regard to minimize the radioactivity levels and address any related processing or environmental concerns. However, they face various challenges such as high chemical reagent consumption, secondary waste generation, and limited selectivity, which hinder either their scalability or sustainability. The current study provides a literature review about these technologies to provide critical insights on their applications and discuss the challenges hampering their extensive use in the mining industry. Biotechnology is also evaluated and highlighted as a promising, cost-effective, and low-environmental-impact option for the selective recovery of radionuclides from rare earth elements. Specifically, pyoverdine siderophores were discussed due to their catecholates and hydroxamate moieties which have high affinity for radionuclides to enhance selective recovery during rare earth processing. Conversely, integration of this approach into existing mineral processing flowsheets is a constraint. Hence, future studies should focus on optimizing the kinetics of siderophore synthesis and explore a hybrid approach to combine the biotechnological and conventional techniques.",MUST_READ,Hydrometallurgy/ESG,"The study reviews conventional radionuclide removal techniques (SX, precipitation) and evaluates emerging biotechnological approaches using siderophores for selective recovery in rare earth processing.","Directly addresses critical mineral processing challenges, impurity removal, and sustainable biotechnological solutions."
Petrogenesis of Himalayan Leucogranites: A Perspective from Zircon Trace Elements,"Weirui Lu, Zeming Zhang, Jia Yuan, Yang Zhang, Qiang Li, Yu An, Di Zhan",2025-12-15,Minerals,Academic,https://doi.org/10.3390/min15121306,"Magmatic zircon trace element compositions and their variation trends provide valuable insights into the nature and evolutionary processes of magmatic rocks. The Himalayan orogen contains widespread leucogranites. Despite extensive studies on these granites, the features and petrogenetic implications of trace element composition of zircons from the leucogranites remain poorly constrained. In this study, we present a comprehensive dataset comprising new cathodoluminescence (CL) images, U-Pb ages, and trace element compositions of zircons from the Himalayan leucogranites, and compare them to the previously reported trace element data of zircon from I-type granites. Our results show that zircons from the Himalayan leucogranites have high Hf, U, Y, P, Th, Sc, and heavy rare earth element contents (HREE), and low Nb, Ta, Ti, and light rare earth element contents (LREE), and can be divided into two types. Type I (low-U) zircons exhibit well-developed oscillatory zoning, and the U concentrations are mostly &lt;5000 ppm. Type II (high-U) zircons display mottled or spongy textures and possess elevated U contents that are mostly &gt;5000 ppm. Zircons from the Himalayan leucogranites have higher contents of U, Hf, Nb, Ta, and elevated U/Yb ratios, but lower Th/U, Eu/Eu*, Ce/Ce*, LREE/HREE, and Ce/U values than those from I-type granitic zircons. Furthermore, zircons in the Himalayan leucogranites have gradually decreasing Th, Ti, Th/U, Eu/Eu*, and Ce/Ce*, and increasing U, Nb, Ta, and (Yb/Gd)N with increasing Hf. These geochemical features suggest the magmas involved in the genesis of leucogranites originated from the partial melting of metasedimentary sources under relatively reduced conditions, and underwent a high degree of magmatic fractionation.",NOT_SURE,Geology/Petrology,This study details the geochemical features and petrogenetic implications of zircon trace element compositions in Himalayan leucogranites.,"Focuses on fundamental petrogenesis and geological history, lacking direct links to ore processing, geometallurgy, or extraction techniques."
Study on the Crystal Structure and Electronic Properties of Tennantite and Enargite,"Dong Yang, Yuqiong Li, Faqi Qu, Meiguang Jiang, Ciren Quni, Wenjie Zhang, Jianhua Chen, Yuxin Guo",2025-12-15,Minerals,Academic,https://doi.org/10.3390/min15121307,"Tennantite (Cu12As4S13) and enargite (Cu3AsS4) are two important minerals that simultaneously contain copper and arsenic. Detailed studies of their structure and properties are crucial for understanding their oxidation, flotation, and leaching. This study investigates the crystal structures, electronic properties, and reactivity of these two copper-arsenic minerals from the perspectives of atomic bonding, charge, density of states, and d-orbital splitting. The results indicate that tennantite is a crystal with mixed Cu valence states of +2 and +1 (predominantly +1), while the Cu in enargite is in the +1 state. The valence state of As in tennantite (+3) is lower than that in enargite (+5). Orbital energy level calculations show that the energy gaps between the copper d-orbitals are small in both minerals, indicating strong electron delocalization and, consequently, strong covalent character in the crystals, which is also confirmed by Mulliken bond population calculations. The presence of arsenic is the reason for the enhanced covalency. It is noteworthy that tennantite exhibits stronger covalency. The Cu 3d and As 4p electrons in tennantite are more electronically active than those in enargite. In tennantite, the strong d-electron delocalization caused by d-p hybridization between Cu and S leads to similar 3d electronic properties between 3-coordinated and 4-coordinated Cu. The energies of the five d-orbitals of the 4-coordinated Cu in enargite are lower than those of the 4-coordinated Cu in tennantite, which may affect the ability of Cu 3d electrons to enter the empty orbitals of S atoms in sulfur-containing collectors to form π back-bonding, thereby reducing the collecting ability of enargite. On the other hand, the splitting energy of the 4-coordinated Cu 3d orbitals in enargite is significantly smaller than that in tennantite, making the structure less stable and, thus, potentially more prone to dissolution.",MUST_READ,Flotation/Hydrometallurgy,"This work analyzes the crystal structure and electronic properties of tennantite and enargite to understand their distinct behaviors during oxidation, flotation, and leaching.",Provides fundamental mineral processing insights into the reactivity and collector interaction of critical copper-arsenic minerals.
"Advanced 3D Inversion of Airborne EM and Magnetic Data with IP Effects and Remanent Magnetization Modeling: Application to the Mpatasie Gold Belt, Ghana","Michael S. Zhdanov, Leif H. Cox, Michael Jorgensen, Douglas H. Pitcher",2025-12-15,Minerals,Academic,https://doi.org/10.3390/min15121305,"We present an integrated methodology for three-dimensional inversion of large-scale airborne electromagnetic (AEM) and magnetic survey data that simultaneously recovers electrical conductivity, chargeability, and both induced and remanent magnetizations. A central feature of the AEM component is the explicit incorporation of induced polarization (IP) effects. Neglecting IP responses can lead to biased conductivity models, particularly in mineralized systems where disseminated sulfides contribute strongly to chargeability. Using the Generalized Effective-Medium Theory of Induced Polarization (GEMTIP), the inversion produces physically consistent 3D distributions of conductivity and chargeability. To enhance magnetic interpretation, we also implement a vector magnetic inversion that resolves both induced and remanent magnetization from Total Magnetic Intensity (TMI) data, enabling geologically realistic magnetization models in terranes with significant remanence. This integrated workflow was applied to airborne AEM and TMI datasets collected over the Asankrangwa Gold Belt in central Ghana. The inversion results delineate a key exploration target defined by coincident magnetic low and elevated chargeability, interpreted as sulfide-rich gold mineralization and subsequently confirmed by drilling. These results demonstrate that jointly accounting for IP and remanent magnetization in 3D inversion substantially improves subsurface characterization and provides a powerful tool for mineral exploration in structurally and lithologically complex environments.",GOOD_TO_READ,Geometallurgy/Exploration,Presents an integrated 3D inversion methodology for airborne EM and magnetic data that explicitly incorporates IP effects and remanent magnetization modeling for better subsurface characterization in mineral exploration.,Important for advanced upstream exploration techniques used to define and characterize mineralized zones prior to mining and processing.

The aim of this work is to identify the structural heredity of the phases formed during thermal transformations of (Y1–xEux)2(SO4)3*8H2O solid solutions, and to study the mechanisms of the thermal deformations of the crystal structure. Structural relations between these phases were found. The crystal structures of YEu(SO4)3*8H2O and (Y0.83Eu0.17)2(SO4)3*8H2O were refined at −173, −123, −73, −23, 27, and 77 °С.

Anode Protection Strategies for Next-Generation Lithium–Oxygen Batteries: Toward Dendrite-Free Lithium Metal at Practical Current Densities,"Myeong-Chang Sung, Minhe Kim, Jiyoon Yu, Changhoon Choi",2025-12-15,Metals,Academic,https://doi.org/10.3390/met15121373,"The promise of lithium–oxygen batteries lie not merely in their record-breaking theoretical energy density, but in the challenge of making such energy truly reversible. Rising as the key obstacle is the lithium metal anode, whose remarkable capacity and low potential come at the cost of dendritic growth, unstable solid electrolyte interphases, and relentless reactions with oxygen species. These instabilities, once overshadowed by cathode-related limitations, now define the frontier of research as current densities and energy demands approach practical levels. This review highlights recent progress in two complementary directions for anode protection: physical approaches, such as artificial protective layers, solid or functional separators, and oxygen-blocking interlayers that isolate and stabilize the surface; and chemical strategies, including electrolyte and additive design that enable in situ formation of LiF- and Li3N-rich interfaces with high ionic conductivity and chemical robustness. Together, these approaches establish a unified framework for achieving dendrite-free and oxygen-resistant lithium interfaces.

However, the environmental and sedimentological conditions that regulate pyrite burial remain poorly constrained. Here we investigate such controlling mechanisms using a non-dimensional diagenetic model that extracts the natural variables governing pyrite formation rate and sulfur isotopic composition ( δ 34 S). Both properties are controlled by the local ratios of organic carbon content to sulfate concentration and organic carbon reactivity to sedimentation rate; formation rate is additionally sensitive to reactive iron delivery. Using only globally interpolated boundary conditions, our model accurately predicts signals in 216 sediment cores distributed across the modern ocean. Extrapolating this, we estimate a global pyrite burial flux of 7.0 × 10 12 mol S yr −1 (sensitivity test range: 2.5 × 10 12 to 19.0 × 10 12 mol S yr −1 ) with a weighted-average δ 34 S value of −4‰ (range: −8 to +3‰). This flux is substantially larger than terrestrial pyrite oxidation, indicating that the sulfur cycle is currently not in steady state but is instead described by net pyrite burial and thus atmospheric O 2 accumulation.

Furthermore, fate tracking experiments reveals that following progenitor division, a cell inheriting fewer mitochondria than its sister consistently differentiates into a neuron.

Assessment of Elemental Partitioning in a Copper Flash Smelting Furnace Under Varying Operational Scenarios,Patricia Córdoba,2025-12-15,Journal of Sustainable Metallurgy,Academic,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40831-025-01369-9,"Abstract This study presents a multi-element, industrial-scale evaluation of elemental partitioning in a copper (Cu) flash smelting furnace under varying dust recirculation conditions. Comprehensive chemical characterization of the smelting feed, matte, slag, and dust was performed across three operational scenarios: no recirculation, partial recirculation (60–70%), and full recirculation (100%). Dust recirculation was found to significantly alter the distribution of volatile, semi-volatile, and refractory elements: emissions of Pb, Zn, Sb, Bi, and Mo increased, while Hg retention in the matte improved. Selenium (Se) and cobalt (Co) remained relatively stable, with partitioning largely controlled by redox conditions and speciation. Statistical analysis enabled classification of elements by sensitivity to recirculation: Type I—highly sensitive (Pb, Zn, Sb, Se, Hg); Type II—moderately sensitive (Mo, Ni); and Type III—stable (Co, Te). These findings, validated with industrial process data, provide critical insights for optimizing residue management, minimizing emissions, and supporting circular economy strategies in primary Cu smelting.

The traditional continuum finite element method (FEM) approaches use the intact rock properties with some reduction by using rock mass classification systems such as the Geological Strength Index and design the slope based on the critical strength reduction factors. A limitation of this approach is that the reduction of the rock mass properties might not be accurate enough for the rock slopes with heavily jointed rock mass. This study uses a three-dimensional Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) approach to understand the inherent limitations of continuum methods in capturing discontinuous rock slope failure with increasing fracture density. The fracture network was constructed from the field data of an iron ore mine comprising detailed face mappings of 560 joints in both the host rock and the iron ore, while the intact rock properties were derived from core samples obtained through 98 boreholes.
